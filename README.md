# TransSight Company Website

Open the **site** folder with WebMatrix:
* If this is the first time, select **Open** from the start-up page, then select **Open Folder**.
** The search page requires PHP and it will detect if PHP is not installed, and ask if you want to install the dependencies.
* Otherwise, select **site** from **My Sites** on the start-up page.
** Click on the **Run** icon (in the top left corner) to launch the site using IISExpress.
